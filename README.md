* You are free to use any language to develop but you can get extra point if you are using one of the JVM languages such as Java, Kotlin and Scala.
* Once the development done, you should create a pull request to the main/master branch in this repo.
* You are free to fill up as much as test data as you want.
* To store the products, you can use an in-memory solution.
* This challange must be completed in a week.
* If you add unit tests, you will get also bonus points.

>Note : It's okay if the code does not run, what matters is how much you stick to good structure and clean code principles.
